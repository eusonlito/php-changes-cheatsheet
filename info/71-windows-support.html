    If a web application is UTF-8 conform, no further action is required. For
    applications depending on paths in non UTF-8 encodings for I/O, an explicit
    INI directive has to be set. The encoding INI settings check relies on the
    order in the core:

  <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
    <span class="simpara">
     internal_encoding

  <p class="para">
    The console output codepage is adjusted depending on the encoding used in
    PHP. Depending on the concrete system OEM codepage, the visible output
    might or might be not correct. For example, in the default cmd.exe and on
    a system with the OEM codepage 437, outputs in codepages 1251, 1252, 1253
    and some others can be shown correctly when using UTF-8. On the same system,
    chars in codepage like 20932 probably won't be shown correctly. This refers
    to the particular system rules for codepage, font compatibility and the
    particular console program used. PHP automatically sets the console codepage
    according to the encoding rules from php.ini. Using alternative consoles
    instead of cmd.exe directly might bring better experience in some cases.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
    Nevertheless be aware, runtime codepage switch after the request start
    might bring unexpected side effects on CLI. The preferable way is php.ini,
    When PHP CLI is used in a console emulator, that doesn't support Unicode,
    it might possibly be required, to avoid changing the console codepage. The
    best way to achieve it is by setting the default or internal encoding to
    correspond the ANSI codepage. Another method is to set the INI directives
    output_encoding and input_encoding to the required codepage, in which case
    however the difference between internal and I/O codepage is likely to cause
    mojibake. In rare cases, if PHP happens to crash gracefully, the original
    console codepage might be not restored. In this case, the chcp command
    can be used, to restore it manually.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
    Special awareness for the DBCS systems - the codepage switch on runtime
    using <span class="function"><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php" class="function">ini_set()</a></span> is likely to cause display issues. The difference to the
    non DBCS systems is, that the extended characters require two console cells
    to be displayed. In certain case, only the mapping of the characters into
    the glyph set of the font could happen, no actual font change. This is the
    nature of DBCS systems, the most simple way to prevent display issues is
    to avoid usage of <span class="function"><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php" class="function">ini_set()</a></span> for the codepage change.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
    As a result of UTF-8 support in the streams, PHP scripts are not limited
    to ASCII or ANSI filenames anymore. This is supported out of the box on
    CLI. For other SAPI, the documentation for the corresponding server
    is useful.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
    Long paths support is transparent. Paths longer than 260 bytes get
    automatically prefixed with <code class="literal">\\?\</code>. The max path length is limited to
    2048 bytes. Be aware, that the path segment limit (basename length) still
    persists.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
    For the best portability, it is strongely recommended to handle filenames,
    I/O and other related topics UTF-8. Additionally, for the console applications,
    the usage of a TrueType font is preferable and the usage of ini_set() for
    the codepage change is discouraged.
