     Improved memory manager and increased default memory limit.
    </span>
    <span class="simpara">
     The new memory manager allocates less memory and works faster than the
     previous incarnation. It allocates memory from the system in large blocks,
     and then manages the heap by itself. The <code class="literal">memory_limit</code> value in <var class="filename">php.ini</var> is
     checked, not for each <code class="literal">emalloc()</code> call (as before), but for actual blocks
     requested from the system. This means that <code class="literal">memory_limit</code> is far more
     accurate than it used to be, since the old memory manager didn't calculate
     all the memory overhead used by the <code class="literal">malloc</code> library.
    </span>
    <span class="simpara">
     Thanks to this new-found accuracy memory usage may appear to have increased,
     although actually it has not. To accommodate this apparent increase, the
     default <code class="literal">memory_limit</code> setting was also increased - from 8 to 16 megabytes.

     Added support for constructors in interfaces to force constructor signature
     checks in implementations.
    </span>
    <span class="simpara">
     Starting with PHP 5.2.0, interfaces can have constructors. However, if you choose
     to declare a constructor in an interface, each class implementing that interface
     MUST include a constructor with a signature matching that of the base interface
     constructor. By 'signature' we mean the parameter and return type definitions,
     including any type hints and including whether the data is passed by reference
     or by value.
