   <p class="para">
    File descriptors are opened in shared read/write/delete mode by default.
    This effectively maps the <abbr class="abbrev">POSIX</abbr> semantics and allows to
    delete files with handles in use. It is not 100% same, some platform
    differences still persist. After the deletion, the filename entry is
    blocked, until all the opened handles to it are closed.
