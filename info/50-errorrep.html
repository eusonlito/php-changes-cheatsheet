    As of PHP 5 the error reporting
    constant <strong><code>E_STRICT</code></strong> is available, with the
    value <code class="literal">2048</code>. When enabled, messages will be
    issued to warn you about code usage which is deprecated or which
    may not be future-proof.
   </p>
   <blockquote class="note"><p><strong class="note">Note</strong>: 
    <span class="simpara">
     <strong><code>E_ALL</code></strong> does not include <strong><code>E_STRICT</code></strong>,
     so it's not enabled by default. You must explicitly set the error
     reporting level to include <strong><code>E_STRICT</code></strong> in order
     to see these messages.
