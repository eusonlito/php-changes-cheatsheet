   <p class="para">
    There were some changes in PHP 5 regarding databases (MySQL and SQLite).
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    In PHP 5 the MySQL client libraries are not bundled, because of license
    and maintenance problems. MySQL is supported with the only
    change being that MySQL support is no longer enabled by 
    <em class="emphasis">default</em> in PHP 5.  This essentially means that
    PHP doesn't include the <strong class="option configure">--with-mysql</strong>
    option in the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.php" class="link">configure</a> line so 
    that you must now manually do this when compiling PHP. Windows users will 
    need to edit <var class="filename">php.ini</var> and enable the <var class="filename">php_mysql.dll</var>
    DLL as in PHP 4 no such DLL existed, it was simply built into your Windows
    PHP binaries.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    There is also a new extension, <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysqli.php" class="link">MySQLi (Improved
     MySQL)</a>, which is designed to work with MySQL 4.1 and above.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    Since PHP 5, the SQLite extension is
    built-in PHP. SQLite is an embeddable SQL database engine and is not a
    client library used to connect to a big database server (like MySQL or
    PostgreSQL). The SQLite library reads and writes directly to and from the
    database files on disk.
